Q.1 Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
Answer:
setTimeout callbacks are executed before any I/O callbacks, but sometimes we might have case 
to run callbacks after finishing I/O eventhandlers. At that time we should use setImmediate, 
which queues the callbacks immedieately after the last I/O handler.

Q.2 Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate ?
Answer:
process.nextTick would be executed at next tick of event loop after immediately compleleting the 
current function. However, the setImmediate, basically has a separate phase in event loop which 
ensures that the callback registered under setImmediate() will be called only after the I/O callback 
and polling phase
